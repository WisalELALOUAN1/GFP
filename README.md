##  Architecture (MVVM)

The **DirhamWay** mobile application is designed using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** architecture. This separation of concerns ensures a robust, testable, and scalable codebase. Below is a breakdown of each layer and its role in the project:

---

###  Model (`data/model/`)
**Purpose:** Represents the data structure and business logic of the application.




**Characteristics:**
- All models are stored locally using **Realm**, offering efficient, object-oriented data persistence.

---

###  ViewModel (`viewmodel/`)
**Purpose:** Acts as an intermediary between the `View` and `Model` layers.

**Responsibilities:**
- Exposes observable `LiveData` to the UI.
- Handles business logic such as filtering transactions, computing balances, and managing budget thresholds.
- Manages asynchronous operations like predictions using **TensorFlow Lite** or data retrieval from the **Realm** database.

---

###  View (`ui/`)
**Purpose:** Represents the user interface and handles user interactions.


**Tools Used:**
- **Android Jetpack** libraries such as `ViewModel`, `LiveData`, `RecyclerView`, and `Material Components`.

---

###  Repository (`data/repository/`)
**Purpose:** Abstracts the data access logic from ViewModels.

**Role:**
- Interacts directly with the **Realm database** for CRUD operations.
- Provides clean APIs for retrieving, saving, or updating `Transaction`, `Goal`, and `UserCategory` data.
- Allows easier testing and mocking of data sources.

---

###  Session Management (`data/session/`)
**Purpose:** Manages authentication state and user context throughout the app.

**Features:**
- Stores the authenticated user‚Äôs ID locally.
- Ensures session continuity between app restarts.
- Used for filtering user-specific data in all views and repositories.

##  Application Screens
Below is a visual walkthrough of the key screens that illustrate the user journey within DirhamWay, from authentication to budget prediction, allowing users to efficiently manage and track their personal finances.
* **Login/Register Screens** (Email or Google)
Allow users to securely authenticate using either their email and password or their Google account, ensuring flexibility and ease of access.

  <p align="center">
  <img src="/Screens/signup.png.jpg" alt="Signup Screen" width="200"/> </p>

* **Dashboard** ( total balance, latest transactions)
Presents a summary of the user's financial status, including current balance and a quick view of recent transactions for better tracking
<p align="center">
<img src="/Screens/dashboard.jpg" alt="Dashboard" width="200"/> </p>

* **Add Transaction** (Form with category, amount, type)
Enables users to add new income or expense entries by specifying the description, amount, type (credit/debit), and category.
<p align="center">
  <img src="/Screens/transactions.jpg" alt="Add Transaction" width="200"/> </p>

* **List of Goals** (Set target amount, current savings, deadline)
Displays all user-defined financial goals, allowing them to view progress and manage targets with deadlines and saved amounts.
<p align="center">
  <img src="/Screens/listeObjective.jpg" alt="Goals List" width="200"/> </p>


* **Report Screen** (PDF export of all goals and transactions)
Provides detailed financial summaries and allows exporting complete reports of goals and transaction history in PDF format.
<p align="center">
  <img src="/Screens/reportInterface.jpg" alt="Report Screen" width="200"/> </p>

* **Prediction Screen** <p align="center">
Uses a machine learning model to suggest an optimized distribution of the user's monthly budget across selected spending categories.
  <img src="/Screens/prediction.png" alt="Prediction Screen" width="200"/> </p>

##  AI Model Integration

We use **TensorFlow Lite** to embed a trained model for predicting budget allocations. The model:

* Takes input parameters like category ID, current month, and day of week.
* Outputs estimated allocation per category.
* Normalizes inputs using MinMax scaling for better accuracy.
* Provides suggestions based on previous spending behavior.
